Every woman's basic NEED and DIGNITY..
image02
Millions of women across the world use sand, ash, old rags, dry grass, newspapers and even plastic sheets in the absence of sanitary pads.
image03
The culture of shame and silence results in great hardship, indignity, and health risk to countless girls and women.

NJPC - A Million Voices is an initiative to bring together voices from around the globe to end the culture of taboo and shame around this natural  process !!
A million voices
bringing together a million
            voices from around the globe on menstruation..
About 65% of women and girls in Kenya can
t afford sanitary pads. Girls loose around 3.5 million learning days every month, due to lack of basic facilities during menses.
At least one in five girls in India drop out of schools due to menstruation
 a research by AC Nielsen and Plan India.
India accounts for 27% of the world
s cervical cancer deaths, almost twice the global average
- WHO. 
poor menstrual hygiene is partly to blame.
 -Doctors
Almost 50% girls of age 14 to 17 knew nothing about menstruation
  a research in Karachi, Pakistan.
The plastic in a pad takes 500 years to degrade. Every year we add the equivalent of 180 billion plastic bags to our waste by using plastic laden feminine hygiene products.
Every year, over 45 billion pads are dumped in landfills in USA and Canada only!!
Barely 12% of India
s menstruating women use sanitary pads, which itself means 36 million women disposing the pads every month!
Over 12 Billion pads and tampons are used once and disposed of annually in USA itself.
Around 70% of women in India say their family can
t afford to buy sanitary pads.
It is  estimated that a woman throws away approx. 125 to 150 kg of sanitary products in her lifetime, a huge addition to the existing garbage.
Cervical cancer kills around 72000 Women in India every year, more than 26% of the deaths worldwide.

About Us
Goonj (means an echo) a multi award-winning social enterprise, started
            the NJPC (Not Just a Piece of Cloth) initiative in 2005, around a
            decade ago. NJPC is focused on opening up the most taboo and ignored
            subject of menstrual hygiene: a female health hazard by involving the
            masses in generating an affordable cloth napkin. The NJPC programme is
            a nationwide intervention, which not only starts with providing a physical
            product but stresses more on changing practices, behavioural patterns,
            education and replication in the long term. MY Pad, Goonj's clean cloth
            pad is developed out of old cloth collected from urban masses. It is
            made with highly indigenous processes while also educating the user
            women to make it on their own.

GOONJ..
GOONJ (means an echo) a multi award winning social enterprise focused to work on ignored basic needs like clothing, sanitary pads for village and slum India while changing the dynamics of giving and receiving with dignity. Using the city‚Äôs discard GOONJ is fueling wide spread development work across village India. Over the last 14 years it has built a network of channels from urban to rural India, channelising clothes and other household material to reach people in most far-flung areas. Turning a city‚Äôs discard into currency for rural development work, GOONJ has innovatively catalysed what is threatening to be a environmental disaster and taken the pressure off monetary inputs for wide ranging rural development.

IT‚ÄôS NOT JUST A PIECE OF CLOTH
The Concept

		Almost a decade ago we were shocked when we came across this ghastly story of a woman who died of tetanus due to a rusted hook in the piece of blouse she used during menses !!  At that time we had no idea about the deep rooted relationship between cloth and menstruation. This story fueled us to go deeper into the non issue.. The Goonj team traveled across the country and found that in the absence of a clean piece of cloth, millions of women in villages and city slums use rags, sand, ash, etc. to deal with their menses..
	
Many share the same piece of cloth with other women in the house as their menstrual cycles are different.
Many women use the same piece of cloth for months till it tears off.
Many women are forced to get their uterus removed at a child bearing age or face infections, risk of cervical cancer because of unhygienic menstrual practices.
Women in cities and villages can‚Äôt even talk about their menstrual challenges in face of restrictions and taboos.
Lakhs of women in cities and villages use cloth sanitary pads and millions do not even have that!!

		It's NOT a women‚Äôs issue, it‚Äôs a Human Issue.. 
	
CLOTH - A Viable Solution

		A humble piece of cotton cloth can save a woman from a lot of indignity, embarrassment and infections. For generations, our mothers and grandmothers have used cloth during their menses. It is the most comfortable, convenient, scalable, available, affordable, acceptable, accessible and eco-friendly solution. A piece of cloth becomes a driving force for a lot of health related issues.  Cloth is not a product but a tool to open dialogue with a woman.
What does Goonj want to do?

For more than a decade now Goonj through its ‚ÄòNot Just a Piece of Cloth‚Äô initiative is working on two things; Make clean cloth available to women who don‚Äôt have any options. Second, it is using this cloth as an entry point into the lives of these women to create a space where they can talk about their challenges and make them aware about the related menstrual health and hygiene challenges. Goonj has also initiated thousands of open discussions to normalize this highly taboo and restricted issue !! Nearly 8 hundred thousand metres of cotton cloth converted into 4 million ‚ÄòMY PADS‚Äô have reached women (across the country) as a solution to deal with her menses.

What can I do

	We strongly feel that the menstrual hygiene issue is much more than the various products in the market. Before we solve the three critical aspects of access to menstrual products, affordability of various options and awareness about menstrual health and hygiene, there is a fundamental aspect of making this issue normal, which is most important. That calls for a change in the larger eco system and mindset of our society. In the cities and villages we can make it normal only if urban women 
&
 men get involved on a deeper level of evoking a long-term awareness and empathy about the chasm in the resources (cotton cloth) between the two strata. That we hope will open more doors for civic participation.

GOONJ..
GOONJ (means an echo) a multi award winning social enterprise focused to work on ignored basic needs like clothing, sanitary pads for village and slum India while changing the dynamics of giving and receiving with dignity. Using the city‚Äôs discard GOONJ is fueling wide spread development work across village India. Over the last 14 years it has built a network of channels from urban to rural India, channelising clothes and other household material to reach people in most far-flung areas. Turning a city‚Äôs discard into currency for rural development work, GOONJ has innovatively catalysed what is threatening to be a environmental disaster and taken the pressure off monetary inputs for wide ranging rural development.

Periods or the natural menstrual cycle are seen as a deeply rooted taboo and this has fueled an innumerable amount of restrictive myths.¬†But the humiliation is worse for women like Aarti, from Baiyal village near Rishikesh in the state of Uttarakhand, northern India, where the menstruation restrictions are even more severe because their communities are so remote from modern life.¬†Here, women are not allowed to even touch other women, not even their mother or sisters, because they

This could be partly attributed to the traditions and rules formed which are reflected in ancient scriptures of every religion.
Then, why are we reflecting back to history to explain this? This is because history plays a major role not just because it gives an insight into the history of regions or places but also into the culture, practices and belief that people possess and those that are still being practiced. But the problem persists when these practices continue despite of their irrational approach in societies which has greatly transformed from those that persisted many years ago. More on
